# SmartDefine

SmartDefine adds instant word explanations to your browser. After installing the extension, select any text on a page and use the context menu to generate an AIâ€‘powered definition. Results open in a minimal modal where you can save the word, export it, or practice later.

The extension supports multiple LLM providers and falls back to a free dictionary service when needed. Saved words are organized into categories and can be reviewed with flashcards, quizzes, or typing exercises using a spaced repetition system.

For a full list of settings, features, and file descriptions see [EXTENSION_DETAILS.md](EXTENSION_DETAILS.md).
